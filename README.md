I have got rid of all the unnecessary code so hopefully this should be enough for you to see what is going on. The my_api.rs file holds all of the code for the spi setup, transmit and read.

I am currently borrowing an oscilliscope from a friend if you need me to test anything out.

Thank you so much for helping me out as I have spent about 2 weeks trying to get this to work and just can't so this is a massive help for me.
